# libmalloc99
Memory efficient implementation of a heap allocator for tms9900-gcc

This is a rather simple but memory efficient heap memory allocator for the tms9900 port of gcc.

## The library assumes the following:
* The .bss segment lives in the higher memory expansion
* The .bss segment is the /last/ segment in memory, everything beyond that up to 0xffff is free
* The \_bss\_end symbol is provided by the linker script (it should be, most crt0.c's rely on it, I believe)

## Known limitations & behavior:
* It uses a single word chunk_info header to keep track of the heap, this means that every call to malloc(size) will result in size + 2 bytes of memory being reserved.
* malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free() are implemented
* freeing incorrect pointers will mess up the heap immediately
* the free() function coalesces where adjacent free chunks of memory are created to avoid too much fragmentation, but it does so in a rather inefficient way. So while malloc() is quite fast, free() can take a bit more time.
* There's a remaining bug, where the last two chuncks are not coalesced, but it shouldn't be an issue in most programs.
